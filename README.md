DESCRIPTION :

# AUTO DOOR PROJECT(https://github.com/Pradeepkumar2123/PLC-PROJECTS/blob/main/AUTO%20DOOR%20PROJECT.isp)
Description:
This project automates door operation using a PLC. When the IR sensor detects a human or object, the forward motor activates and opens the door. Once two limit switches are triggered, the forward motor stops and a timer starts. After the set delay, the reverse motor turns ON to close the door, and it stops automatically when the third limit switch is triggered. The system ensures smooth, contactless, and reliable door control.

Features:
Automatic door operation using IR sensor detection
Sequential control through PLC logic
Timed delay for convenient entry/exit
Safety ensured using limit switches
Contactless and energy-efficient system
